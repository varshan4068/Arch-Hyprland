# âœ¨ Arch-Hyprland  
                                                                                                                                                                 
  clone my repository using : 

    git clone https://github.com/varshan4068/Arch-Hyprland.git

  Just run the install.sh in your hyprland window manager using

    cd Arch-Hyprland/
    ./install.sh 


  It's recommended to go through the install.sh script once because in the script i have included the script for installing my needed dependencies,so you can alter the script accordingly for your needs of installing your needed dependencies...

 
  After everything is setup using nwg-look select the dracula-gtk theme 

  
  And bash is configured with starship prompt 

  
  You can customise the colorscheme of kitty by typing the following command on your kitty terminal

     theme

  Some basic Keybindings in my hyprland configuration were,

    Super + a --> Rofi 
    Super + e --> Thunar file manager
    Super + d --> Gnome-disk-utility
    Super + return --> kitty 
    Super + p --> Retoggling the waybar
    Super + w --> Rofi-wifi-menu 
    Super + v --> vscode
    Super + c --> Used for Closing Apps
    print screen key --> screenshot with hyprshot 


  To Know About All keybindings just refer the hyprland.conf at ~/.config/hypr 
  
  
  This repo also includes a very basic and useful plugins for neovim like neo-tree treesitter nvim-cmp , etc.... with catppuccin color scheme

  
  The sddm themes were taken from the repo  
      
    https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme.git

  
  That's it these were my personally used hyprland configuration , feel free to try out my dotfiles if any issues or bugs in my dotfiles report it and i would solve   the issues quickly... 

  
  These repo will be updated when changes were made in my personal configurations and in case of any bugs in my code......
