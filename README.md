  At First clone my repository using : 

  git clone https://github.com/varshan4068/Arch-Hyprland.git

  Just run the install.sh in your hyprland window manager using
  
  ./install.sh 

  This dotfiles were only tested on arch linux so try it with other distros on your own risk....

  This repo also includes a very basic and useful plugins for neovim like neo-tree tressiter nvim-cmp , etc.... 

  That's it these were my personally used hyprland configuration , feel free to try out my dotfiles if any issues or bugs in my dotfiles report it and i would solve the problems...
